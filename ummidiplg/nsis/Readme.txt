To generate the installer plugin, you need the Nullsoft Installer System.
Inside that, there's an example PlugIn; it can be found at
  %ProgramFiles(x86)%\NSIS\Examples\Plugin
which has a subdirectory called
  nsis

To ensure you got the matching files to generate this plugin with your
NSIS version, copy the contents of the nsis subdirectory of the example
plugin into this directory.
